== iUI Seed Project using Spring Boot

This is a prototype "seed" project that uses http://www.iui-js.org[iUI] on the client and http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] on the server.

== Directory Structure

As follows.

  * +src/main/webapp+ - directory contains static HTML and resources
  * +src/main/java+ - directory contains Java source code for Configuration, Controllers, etc.
  * +build.gradle+ - Gradle build file
  
== Running

    ./gradlew build ; java -jar path/file.war

NOTE:: It would be nice to have single Gradle command to build and run.
    
== Building

To create an "exectable WAR" in the +build/libs+ directory:

    ./gradlew build
    
To run that app:

    java -jar build/libs/iuiseed-0.1.0.war

== To manually deploy to CloudBees

    ./gradlew cloudBeesAppDeployArchive
